      <section id="summary" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Digital commerce is entering a structural transition. Systems designed around search,
          ranking, and paid visibility are increasingly misaligned with how people want to buy
          and how businesses want to sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIA addresses this mismatch by enabling agentic commerce. Instead of optimising for
          attention, VIA enables intent-first interaction, where autonomous and semi-autonomous
          agents act on behalf of buyers and sellers to discover, negotiate, and coordinate
          transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIA is designed to operate across the AI assistants people already use, functioning
          as neutral coordination infrastructure rather than a marketplace, advertising
          platform, or closed ecosystem.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="problem" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Most digital commerce systems are built around being seen. Businesses pay to compete
          for impressions, ranking, and reach, regardless of whether the audience has any
          realistic intent to purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          For consumers, this results in overwhelming results, persistent advertising, and
          increasing effort to reach confident decisions. For businesses, it results in high
          acquisition costs, wasted spend, and limited visibility into genuine demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system rewards volume and visibility rather than relevance and readiness.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="shift" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>The Shift to Agentic Commerce</h2>
        <p>
          Digital commerce has progressed from search-led discovery to social-led influence.
          The next phase is agent-mediated execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of browsing and comparing manually, users express intent in everyday language.
          Agents translate that intent into structured requirements, engage relevant supply, and
          return outcomes that can be approved, refined, or executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user shifts from managing complexity to setting boundaries and making final
          decisions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="definition" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>What Makes Commerce Agentic</h2>
        <p>
          Agentic commerce is defined by execution rather than conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          An agentic system can capture intent, translate it into constraints, evaluate and
          negotiate supply, execute transactions within defined authority, and manage
          post-purchase actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The defining characteristic is autonomy under guardrails. Agents act, but only within
          limits defined by users or merchants.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="adoption" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>Adoption Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          Agentic commerce will be adopted progressively. Low-risk and repeat purchases will be
          delegated first, followed by draft-and-approve flows for higher-consideration
          decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adoption depends on transparency, reversibility, and control. Users must understand
          why actions were taken and be able to adjust or undo them easily.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="architecture" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>System Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          VIA is an intent-driven, agent-native commerce coordination system composed of four
          core layers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Intent and Interface Layer</li>
          <li>Agent Identity and Trust</li>
          <li>Messaging and Discovery</li>
          <li>Economic Settlement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          VIA captures intent before it becomes a transaction and routes it through a neutral,
          protocol-driven coordination framework.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="coordination" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>The VIA Coordination Framework</h2>
        <p>
          VIA aligns intent schemas, agent trust rules, messaging conventions, and agentic
          payment logic without centralising control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discovery is routed rather than broadcast. Trust is accumulated through observable
          behaviour rather than inherited from platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIA is designed to interoperate with existing commerce infrastructure rather than
          replace it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="trust" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>FA$H as a Trust Enhancement Layer</h2>
        <p>
          FA$H is an existing ERC-20 token intended to support trust-related mechanisms as
          agentic commerce matures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potential applications include agent credibility signalling, participation
          thresholds, and economic backstops for dispute resolution, reinforcing trust through
          observable commitment rather than reputation alone.
        </p>

      <section id="conclusion" class="content-section lite-paper-section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Agentic commerce represents a rebalancing of effort, trust, and control in digital
          markets. It does not remove choice, but changes who processes it.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIA is designed to support this transition by enabling intent-first coordination
          without opacity, lock-in, or dependency on attention-based models.
